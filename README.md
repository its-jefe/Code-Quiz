# 04 Web APIs: <s>Code Quiz</s> Awesome Quiz

## Welcome to the Awesome Quiz! 
### With your host, GitHub Pages!

This silly quiz game is the [fourth project][2] for [UCF Coding Bootcamp][1] and implements:
- Timers (`setTimout`, `setInterval`)
- `Localstorage`
- `JavaScript` with `DOM` manipulation
- Fun `CSS` animations

The kitschy backdrop was created in Adobe Illustrator.

## Rules
You have 60 seconds to correctly answer 5 questions...

Sounds easy enough, BUT, if you answer incorrectly you are penalized 15 seconds.

Points are awarded for speed and correctness and at the end you can save your [local] score with your initials to the high-score board.

Just hit the start button to begin the awesomeness.

## Future Improvements

1. Add more questions
2. Keep the highscores on a server instead of only locally
