# 04 Web APIs: <s>Code Quiz</s> Awesome Quiz

#### Up and running @ https://its-jefe.github.io/Code-Quiz/

#### Offical [grading criteria][2] for this project.

## Welcome to the Awesome Quiz! 
### With your host, GitHub Pages!

This silly quiz game is my fourth project for [UCF Coding Bootcamp][1] and implements:
- timers (setTimout, setInterval)
- DOM manipulation
- localstorage
- JS logic
- CSS animation. 

The kitschy backdrop was created in Adobe Illustrator.

## Rules
You have 60 seconds to correctly answer 5 questions...

Sounds easy enough, BUT, if you answer incorrectly you are penalized 15 seconds.

Points are awarded for speed and correctness and at the end you can save your [local] score with your initials to the high-score board.

Just hit the start button to begin the awesomeness.

## Future Improvements

1. Add more questions
2. Keep the highscores on a server instead of only locally
